# Ines Souissi Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Ines, and I am a machine learning developer. I have always been passionate about using data to gain insights and drive decision-making, and my portfolio showcases some of the projects that I have worked on to demonstrate my skills and experience in this field.

# [Project 1: Disaster tweets](https://github.com/InesSouissi98/-Disaster-tweets)
