# Ines Souissi Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Ines, and I am a machine learning developer. I have always been passionate about using data to gain insights and drive decision-making, and my portfolio showcases some of the projects that I have worked on to demonstrate my skills and experience in this field.

# [Project 1: Disaster tweets](https://github.com/InesSouissi98/-Disaster-tweets)
This project is about building a machine learning model that predicts which tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. <br>
**Tools:*** <br >
Programming language: Python <br >
Data preprocessing and analysis libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn and keras. <br >
Natural language processing libraries: Tokenizer, CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer. <br >
Machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression


# [Project 2: Diamond_price_prediction](https://github.com/InesSouissi98/Diamond_price_prediction)
The goal of this project is to predict the price of the diamonds. <br>
***Tools:*** <br>
Programming language: Python <br>
Data preprocessing and analysis libraries: pandas, NumPy. <br>
data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn.<br>
Machine learning algorithms: XGBRegressor, random forests. <br>


# [Project 3: Breast cancer prediction](https://github.com/InesSouissi98/Breast_cancer_prediction)
Classifying mammograms into normal cases or cancer cases using several pretrained models


# [Project 4: chest-x-ray prediction](https://github.com/InesSouissi98/chest-x-ray_prediction)
The project detects and classifies pneumonia disease from X-Ray images.

# [Project 5: Image forecasting](https://github.com/InesSouissi98/Image_forecasting)
This project used a linear method for image-based time series forecasting

# [Project 6: Maize crops classification](https://github.com/InesSouissi98/Maize_crops_classification)
The objective of this project is to classify if a plant has been affected by a fall armyworm.


# [Project 7: Mammogram retrieval](https://github.com/InesSouissi98/mammogram_retrieval)
This project applies content-based mammogram retrieval method using dynamic distances for the decison making.
